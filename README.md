Journey and self-developing Data Science experience!. 

*** Files for each learning stage will be uploaded in their own Jupyter Notebook file. 
    This file will be beginner friendly, those who have just started with no strong background in programming.
    Please make sure your contributions fall into that category and thank y'all ***

the 'students_performance.csv' file is associated with '01_project_dsp'

#### Steps followed :
1. Importing libraries
2. Importing dataset

4. Load the dataset:
Open the CSV file using Python and read its contents. Store the data in appropriate data structures (lists, dictionaries, etc.).

5. Explore the dataset:
Grouping and aggregating data: You can group the data based on one or more columns and perform aggregations on the numerical columns. For example, you can calculate the mean math, reading, and writing scores for each gender, parental level of education, or race/ethnicity group.

6. Filtering data, and Creating new columns
You can filter the dataframe based on specific conditions. For instance, you can filter the data to only include students who scored above a certain threshold in math, reading, or writing.

You can create new columns based on existing columns. For example, you can calculate the total score by summing up the math, reading, and writing scores. You can also create a categorical column to indicate whether a student passed or failed based on a certain score threshold.

5. Visualizing the data:
You can create various plots and visualizations to explore the relationships between different variables. For example, you can create bar plots or box plots to compare the average scores across different categories such as gender, parental level of education, or test preparation course.

6. Analyzing relationships:
You can analyze the relationships between variables using statistical methods. For instance, you can calculate the correlation between math, reading, and writing scores to determine if there is a relationship between these subjects.
